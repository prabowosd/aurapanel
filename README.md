AuraPanel is a modern hosting control plane focused on three non-negotiables:

- `Performance first`: low-overhead runtime design and deterministic automation
- `Reliability first`: control plane is decoupled from serving plane
- `Security first`: fail-closed APIs, strict RBAC, and explicit runtime state

AuraPanel is being built for 2026-grade infrastructure operations where platform teams need clear control over website, DNS, SSL, mail, database, and service lifecycle in one coherent panel.

## Vision

AuraPanel is not a thin UI over shell commands.

It is an operator-grade control plane for hosting businesses, infrastructure teams, and multi-tenant environments that need:

- stable website serving under operational load
- transparent and testable automation paths
- low-friction day-2 operations
- clear security boundaries between users, services, and host-level actions

The core principle is simple: websites must keep running even when panel components are restarted, upgraded, or temporarily unavailable.

## Why AuraPanel

AuraPanel is designed around operational honesty:

- if a feature is not wired to a real host/API/config path, it should not be marked as active
- unsupported flows return `501 Not Implemented` rather than fake success
- acceptance checks and runtime probes are part of normal operations, not optional extras

This approach reduces hidden risk, shrinks mean-time-to-diagnose, and keeps teams aligned with real production state.

## Architecture

```text
Browser
  -> Vue Frontend
  -> Go API Gateway
  -> Go Panel Service
  -> Host Services / Integrations
     - OpenLiteSpeed
     - MariaDB
     - PostgreSQL
     - Postfix
     - Dovecot
     - Pure-FTPd
     - PowerDNS
     - Redis
     - MinIO
     - Docker
     - WP-CLI
     - Cloudflare
```

### Control Plane Layers

`frontend/`
- Vue + Vite operator UI
- workflow-oriented views for hosting lifecycle
- RBAC-aware frontend permission boundaries

`api-gateway/`
- central authenticated entry point
- JWT validation, middleware chain, request IDs, CORS, RBAC checks
- controlled proxying to panel-service
- static panel delivery in production

`panel-service/`
- host-level automation and runtime orchestration
- provisioning, tuning, hardening, backup, migration, and integration endpoints
- deterministic command/config workflows across Linux environments

## Feature Surface

AuraPanel includes real runtime integrations for:

- Website lifecycle: domain onboarding, vhost sync, rewrite handling, htaccess write-through
- SSL/TLS: issuance, custom certs, wildcard bindings, hostname mapping
- DNS: zone and record lifecycle with PowerDNS
- Mail stack: Postfix, Dovecot, mailbox provisioning, forward/catch-all flows
- FTP/SFTP: account and access management
- Databases: MariaDB/PostgreSQL provisioning, credentials, tuning, remote access controls
- Backup: website and database backups, MinIO target support
- Docker runtime: service/app lifecycle endpoints
- Cloudflare integration surfaces
- WordPress workflows through `wp-cli`
- Malware scan and quarantine flows
- Firewall and SSH key management
- Panel port and service process visibility
- Migration upload, analysis, and import paths

For explicit runtime endpoint status, see [ENDPOINT_AUDIT.md](./ENDPOINT_AUDIT.md).

## Security Model

AuraPanel follows a zero-trust, fail-closed model:

- every protected request must be authenticated
- role-based access controls are enforced at the gateway
- unsupported routes do not return cosmetic success payloads
- installer writes environment/runtime artifacts with controlled permissions
- release bootstrap supports manifest and hash verification
- firewall automation opens only required ports
- generated credentials are validated through smoke checks
- ModSecurity + OWASP CRS integration can be enabled for WAF coverage

Security posture is treated as an always-on runtime property, not a one-time installation checkbox.

## Performance Model

Performance-sensitive decisions in AuraPanel:

- `Decoupled serving path`: websites are served by OpenLiteSpeed, not by panel runtime
- `Go services`: predictable startup and memory behavior
- `Focused proxy layer`: API Gateway forwards core `/api/v1/` surface directly to panel-service
- `Deterministic integrations`: host operations through managed CLI/config flows
- `Operational isolation`: panel updates/restarts do not imply website downtime

## Comparison Snapshot

This is a technical positioning snapshot (not a licensing/pricing comparison).

| Area | AuraPanel | CyberPanel | cPanel/WHM | Plesk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core positioning | Decoupled control plane + explicit runtime honesty | OLS-centric panel with fast setup path | Mature commercial standard for shared hosting | Mature commercial platform with extension ecosystem |
| Serving/Control separation | Strong architectural focus | Moderate, depends on deployment style | Historically integrated workflows | Integrated with broad extension stack |
| Runtime transparency | Emphasis on verifiable host-backed endpoints | Varies by module | Mature UI abstractions, less host-level transparency by default | Strong UX abstractions via extensions |
| Security posture goal | Zero-trust defaults, fail-closed behavior | Basic hardening available | Enterprise features via commercial tiers | Enterprise/security add-ons via extensions |
| Extensibility direction | API/gRPC-first roadmap, GitOps-friendly | Plugin ecosystem, OLS-focused | Commercial ecosystem and partner integrations | Large extension catalog |
| Ops philosophy | Deterministic automation over cosmetic completeness | Simplicity and speed | Operational maturity and market standardization | Broad compatibility and managed workflows |

## Live Demo

- URL: `https://demo.aurapanel.info`
- Email: `demo@aurapanel.info`
- Password: `1234567`
- Mode: strict read-only demo account

Demo access is intentionally restricted. Mutating operations (create/update/delete, service control, write actions) are blocked at the API gateway level so visitors can explore the panel safely without changing host state.

## Roadmap Direction

Near-term platform direction:

- service-to-service trust tightening and token lifecycle hardening
- eBPF-backed telemetry and runtime drift detection
- deeper GitOps control loops for repeatable fleet operations
- richer migration assistants for cPanel/Plesk/CyberPanel transitions
- expanded operator analytics and auto-remediation recommendations

## Contribution Principles

- keep runtime claims honest
- prioritize real integrations over simulated responses
- avoid heavy dependencies without measurable value
- preserve control-plane and serving-plane decoupling
- treat host-level automation as production infrastructure code
